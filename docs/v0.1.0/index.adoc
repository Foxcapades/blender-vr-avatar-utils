The following documents the options and features included in the VR Avatar Utils
({abbr-vau}) Blender addon.

== Armatures

=== Bone Rotation Mode Normalization

Normalizes the transform rotation mode on all bones in an armature to the chosen
mode value.

[TIP]
--
Why?::
When applying poses from assets or from other armatures, having bones with
conflicting rotation modes can lead to the pose being applied incorrectly.
+
Frequently when an avatar base has a small number of bones with a different
rotation mode than the rest, it was unintentional.

==== Options

[%header, cols='2,1,7']
|===
| Option | Type | Description

| Dry Run
| Toggle
| Sets whether the addon should perform a dry run on execution.  This means,
when enabled, that the addon will not actually change anything and will instead
report the changes that it wanted to make.

It is recommended that operations are first performed with Dry Run enabled to
ensure that all the changes that would be made are desired.

| Rotation Mode
| Dropdown
| Chooses the rotation mode that will be set on all the bones in the armature.

These options align with the modes outlined in

.Mesh Operations

=== Shape Key Value Synchronization

Synchronizes the values of shape keys from a source mesh object to matching
shape keys on all other mesh objects in the scene or file.

Shape keys are matched on name, meaning only shape keys with a name matching a
shape key on the source object will be updated on a target object.  This
feature does not add or remove shape keys.

[TIP]
--
Why?::
This may come in handy while working on accessories for an avatar base that have
shape keys to match morphs available on the base.  For example, when creating a
shirt for an avatar that has height/weight options, this enables easily updating
the accessory to match those morphs on the base.

Can't you use drivers for this?::
You can, however, I have found that the time and effort cost of setting up
drivers outweighs the benefit for small scale work such as modding an avatar.

== Integrations

[#key-sync-integration-skp]
=== Shape Keys+

When the {link-skp} addon is also installed and enabled, {abbr-vau} will offer
different options for synchronizing shape keys.  As the Shape Keys+ addon hides
the ability to toggle shape key locking and adds the ability to select shape
keys or folders of shape keys, the 'Ignore Locked' option will be replaced with
2 new options, 'Only from Selected' and 'Only to Selected' which control which
shape keys are synced from the source object to target objects.
