= VR Avatar Utilities
:icons: font

:plugin-version: 0.2.0

:url-gh-repo: https://github.com/Foxcapades/blender-vr-avatar-utils

A growing collection of utilities that I have created to assist my workflows
working on optimizing and creating custom content for VR avatars in Blender.

link:https://foxcapades.github.io/blender-vr-avatar-utils/v{plugin-version}/[ðŸ“– *Documentation*]

Developed against Blender 4.1.1.  May technically be compatible with previous
Blender versions but has not been tested on any.

== Features

This plugin adds new collapsible panels titled "VR Avatar Utils" to the "Data"
tab in the "Armature" and "Mesh" contexts.

=== Armatures

==== Bone Rotation Mode Normalization

Allows converting the transform rotation mode of all bones in an armature to a
target value without altering the rotation.


=== Meshes

==== Synchronize Shape Keys

Synchronizes the values of shape keys on the current mesh with matching shape
keys on other meshes in the scene or file.


==== Invert Shape Keys

Allows inverting a shape key, making the shape key value the new basis and
creating a new shape key which returns the object to its former basis state (or
alternatively a custom toggle state).


==== Rename Shape Keys

Allows mass renaming of shape keys across all meshes in the scene or file.

== Development

=== Project Structure

The source for the project exists entirely under the `src/` directory.  Under
this directory are the following packages:

`bpy`::
This is a reference package providing type definitions as a stand-in for the
real Blender `bpy` library.  This package does not contain any functional code,
only `Protocol` and `Literal` definitions built on Python's `typing` package
that enable smart editor features such as autocomplete and type based error
checking.
+
The actual `bpy` library available via pip is heavyweight and requires
additional transitive dependencies whereas this reference package only depends
on the Python standard library.
+
The code in this package is *not* included in the addon distribution zip.

`fxcpds_vr_avatar_utils`::
This package contains the implementation of the addon.  This is the only package
that is included in the addon distribution zip.
+
This package has no dependencies outside itself and the Blender `bpy` library.

`mathutils`::
Similar to the included `bpy` package, this is a reference package that provides
type definitions for components of the Blender `mathutils` package. This package
does not contain any functional code.
+
The code in this package is *not* included in the addon distribution zip.

`scripts`::
Miscellaneous scripts that have been used to aid my workflow that are included
for reference or prototyping new addon features.
+
The code in this package is *not* included in the addon distribution zip.
